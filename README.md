# ⛅ Simple Weather App

A weather checking app where the user can enter a location and get current weather details.  
It fetches live weather data and displays temperature, humidity, and conditions on the screen.  

This project was my **first time securely deploying an API key** using a backend server.  
I faced many challenges while setting it up, but I learned a lot about **APIs, JSON responses, async JavaScript, backend servers, and environment variables**.  
Moving forward, I plan to build many more such projects to strengthen my understanding of full-stack workflows. 🚀  

## 📂 Project Structure  

- **[Frontend (weather-frontend)](https://github.com/anshika-pathak005/weather-frontend)**  
  - Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  - Handles the UI where users can input a location and view the weather details.  

- **[Backend (weather-backend)](https://github.com/anshika-pathak005/weather-backend)**  
  - A simple Express.js server deployed on Render.  
  - Stores the API key securely in environment variables.  
  - Acts as a middle layer between the frontend and the OpenWeather API.
